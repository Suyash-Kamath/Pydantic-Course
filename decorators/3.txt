Yes! Great observation.

✅ **Packing and unpacking** are both happening in this code. Let's break it down clearly:

---

### 🧳 What is Packing?

**Packing** happens when `*args` and `**kwargs` **gather** any number of positional and keyword arguments into tuples and dictionaries.

#### In this line:

```python
def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
```

* `*args` **packs** all positional arguments into a tuple.
* `**kwargs` **packs** all keyword arguments into a dictionary.

🔹 Example:

```python
@cache
def greet(name, age=0):
    return f"Hi {name}, age {age}"

greet("Hari", age=25)
```

➡️ Inside `wrapper`, it becomes:

```python
args = ('Hari',)
kwargs = {'age': 25}
```

---

### 🎁 What is Unpacking?

**Unpacking** happens when `*args` and `**kwargs` are used to **pass** the arguments to another function.

#### In this line:

```python
result = func(*args, **kwargs)
```

Here, `*args` and `**kwargs` are **unpacked** — the tuple and dictionary are broken down and passed as individual arguments to `func`.

So this:

```python
func(*args, **kwargs)
```

is the same as doing:

```python
func('Hari', age=25)
```

---

### ⚠️ One subtle bug in your code:

You're only caching based on `args`:

```python
if args in cache_values:
```

But `kwargs` is ignored in the key, which means:

```python
func(2, b=3)  # kwargs
func(2, 3)    # only args
```

→ Might produce **wrong cache reuse** even if arguments differ!

---

### ✅ Correct way (including kwargs):

To make it cache based on both positional and keyword arguments, you can do:

```python
def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))
    if key in cache_values:
        return cache_values[key]
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    cache_values[key] = result
    return result
```

`frozenset` is used because dictionaries are unhashable and can't be used as keys — but frozenset of its items can.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Concept   | Where It Happens               |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Packing   | `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs)` |
| Unpacking | `func(*args, **kwargs)`        |

Let me know if you want to explore how caching affects performance or how to add a size limit to the cache (like LRU cache)!


Absolutely, let's go step by step.

---

## ✅ Modified Version: Correct Caching with `args` + `kwargs`

```python
def cache(func):
    cache_values = {}

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # ✅ Create a key using args and frozenset of kwargs
        key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

        if key in cache_values:
            return cache_values[key]

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache_values[key] = result
        return result

    return wrapper
```

---

## 🔍 Why was the change needed?

Previously, you only did:

```python
if args in cache_values:
```

That means it only checks for positional arguments.

But if someone uses **keyword arguments**, like:

```python
slow_add(2, b=3)
```

and another calls:

```python
slow_add(2, 3)
```

These are **not the same**, but your old cache treats them as identical because `kwargs` was ignored.

So, now we combine:

* `args`: tuple of positional arguments (already hashable ✅)
* `kwargs.items()`: converted to `frozenset`, which is hashable ✅

Now the cache key becomes:

```python
((2,), frozenset({('b', 3)}))
```

---

## ❗ Why can’t we just do this?

```python
key = (args, kwargs)
```

Because `kwargs` is a `dict`, and:

### 🔥 Dicts are **unhashable**

* Why? Because **mutable** objects (like `dict`) can **change**, and dictionaries use hash keys that must **stay the same**.
* Hashable = can be used as a dictionary key or set element.
* Mutable = contents can change → so hash value can become inconsistent → unsafe.

---

## 🧊 What is `frozenset`?

Think of `frozenset` as:

> A frozen (immutable) version of a `set`.

### ✅ Key points:

* It cannot be changed after creation (immutable).
* It is **hashable**, so can be used as a key in a dictionary or an element in a set.
* Useful to represent unordered collections that shouldn’t change.

### Example:

```python
s = frozenset([("a", 1), ("b", 2)])
print(hash(s))  # ✅ works
```

But:

```python
d = {("a", 1): 100}
print(hash(d))  # ❌ error: dict is unhashable
```

---

### 🎯 TL;DR Summary:

| Concept             | Explanation                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*args`             | Packs positional arguments into a tuple                                  |
| `**kwargs`          | Packs keyword arguments into a dictionary                                |
| `frozenset`         | Immutable and hashable version of set — used to make kwargs hashable     |
| `kwargs` unhashable | Because dicts can change, they cannot be used as dictionary keys         |
| New cache key       | `(args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))` — makes it cache-safe for all inputs |

---

Want me to show you this with a working function and print output?

Absolutely Hari! Let me now **explain everything in a real-life friendly and crystal clear way** — no jargon, no shortcuts.

---

## 💡 Let's understand **"Hashable"** first

### 📦 Hashable means:

Something can be used as a **key in a dictionary** or **stored in a set** — but **only** if it **cannot change** after being created.

Why? Because dictionary keys and set elements **must stay the same forever** — like a **label on a locker**. You can't change the label after sticking it on.

---

## ❓So what is considered **Hashable**?

| Type        | Hashable? | Why?                                     |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `int`       | ✅ Yes     | Cannot change                            |
| `str`       | ✅ Yes     | Cannot change                            |
| `tuple`     | ✅ Yes     | But only if inside data is also hashable |
| `list`      | ❌ No      | Can be changed anytime                   |
| `dict`      | ❌ No      | Keys/values can change                   |
| `set`       | ❌ No      | Unordered & changeable                   |
| `frozenset` | ✅ Yes     | Frozen version of set — immutable        |

---

## 🧪 Quick Code Examples:

```python
hash(5)            # ✅ Okay
hash("hello")      # ✅ Okay
hash((1, 2))       # ✅ Okay
hash([1, 2])       # ❌ Error: list is unhashable
hash({"a": 1})     # ❌ Error: dict is unhashable
```

---

## 🧊 What is `frozenset` and why do we need it?

Let’s say you have this dictionary:

```python
kwargs = {'age': 25, 'location': 'Mumbai'}
```

You **can't** use this directly as a key:

```python
key = (args, kwargs)       # ❌ error
```

But if you **freeze** the dictionary’s items into a `frozenset`:

```python
frozenset(kwargs.items())  # ✅ okay
```

It becomes something like:

```python
frozenset({('age', 25), ('location', 'Mumbai')})
```

This **can now be used as a dictionary key**.

---

## 🔄 Real-life Analogy

### Think of `dict` like a "Whiteboard":

* You can erase or change what's written — mutable
* You **can't** use a whiteboard as a permanent locker key — because it changes

### Think of `frozenset` like a "Stone-carved slab":

* Once carved, it can't be changed — immutable
* So it **can** be used as a locker key (a key in a dictionary)

---

## 🧠 So why is `tuple` hashable and `list` not?

* **`list`**: Mutable (you can change its content anytime)

  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2]
  my_list.append(3)  # Changes content
  ```

* **`tuple`**: Immutable (you can't change its content after creation)

  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2)
  # my_tuple[0] = 10  # ❌ Error
  ```

So `tuple` can be **safely used as a key**. But `list` and `dict` cannot.

BUT: a tuple is **only hashable** if **all its elements** are also hashable.

---

## 💥 Final Practical Example

```python
def cache(func):
    cache_values = {}

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))  # make key from both

        if key in cache_values:
            return cache_values[key]

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache_values[key] = result
        return result

    return wrapper
```

This makes sure **every combination of inputs** (positional + keyword) is cached safely.

---

## ✅ TL;DR Summary:

| Concept       | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hashable**  | Can be used as dictionary key or set item (must be immutable)                |
| **Tuple**     | Hashable if inside elements are hashable                                     |
| **List**      | ❌ Not hashable because it can change                                         |
| **Dict**      | ❌ Not hashable (mutable)                                                     |
| **frozenset** | ✅ Hashable version of a set — used to represent dict safely as part of a key |

---

Still unsure? Want to play with this interactively? I can make a small demo code you can run to see how hashable vs unhashable works.

Great question! Let's go step by step and **explain exactly why the second call still takes time**, even though it looks like the same input.

---

## 🧠 Your Decorator Works Like This:

You're caching based on this:

```python
if args in cache_values:
```

That means you're using **only `args` (positional arguments)** to check the cache.

---

## Let's see your calls one by one:

```python
print(long_running_function(1, b=2))  # ⏳ SLOW — kwargs used
print(long_running_function(1, b=2))  # ⏳ SLOW AGAIN — still uses kwargs!
print(long_running_function(1, 2))    # ⏳ SLOW — args used
print(long_running_function(3, 4))    # ⏳ SLOW — new input
```

---

## 🤯 But wait! `1 + 2` is the same, right?

Yes — **but the way you passed the arguments matters**.

Let’s look at what gets stored as `args` and `kwargs` inside the `wrapper()`:

| Function Call                   | `args`   | `kwargs`   | Cache Key Used |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| `long_running_function(1, b=2)` | `(1,)`   | `{'b': 2}` | `(1,)` → wrong |
| `long_running_function(1, 2)`   | `(1, 2)` | `{}`       | `(1, 2)`       |

In the first case:

* You pass `b` as a keyword argument.
* So `args = (1,)`, and `kwargs = {'b': 2}`

Your code checks:

```python
if args in cache_values:  # only (1,) is checked
```

It **ignores** `kwargs`!

So the cache doesn’t recognize the second call as a repeat — it recomputes.

---

## ✅ Solution: Fix your key to use both `args` and `kwargs`

Use this updated version of the decorator:

```python
def cachee(func):
    cache_values = {}

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))  # use both args and kwargs

        if key in cache_values:
            return cache_values[key]

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache_values[key] = result
        return result

    return wrapper
```

---

## Now run this:

```python
@cachee
def long_running_function(a, b):
    time.sleep(4)
    return a + b

print(long_running_function(1, b=2))  # ⏳ slow
print(long_running_function(1, b=2))  # ⚡ fast
print(long_running_function(1, 2))    # ⚡ fast
print(long_running_function(3, 4))    # ⏳ slow
```

This will now cache results **correctly** for all combinations of args and kwargs.

---

## 🔑 Summary:

* Your original code only cached `args` → ignored `kwargs`.
* That's why calling `f(1, b=2)` didn’t match the cache.
* Solution: Use both `args` and `frozenset(kwargs.items())` to build a complete and hashable key.

Let me know if you want me to print the keys being stored — it’ll help you see what’s happening inside the cache!

Perfect Hari! Let’s now **break it down slowly** and explain why **dictionaries (`dict`) are unhashable** with **a real code example**, visuals, and analogy.

---

## 🚀 First: What is "Hashable"?

* **Hashable** means: an object has a fixed "identity" (a hash value) and can be used as:

  * A **key in a dictionary**
  * An **element in a set**

### ✅ Example of hashable things:

```python
x = (1, 2)         # tuple
y = "hello"        # string
z = 5              # integer

# All can be used as keys
my_dict = {
    x: "Tuple!",
    y: "String!",
    z: "Number!"
}
```

No problem. These are hashable.

---

## ❌ Now: What if we try to use a `dict` as a key?

```python
my_dict = {
    {"a": 1}: "Data"  # ❌
}
```

You will get this error:

```
TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
```

---

## 🧪 Why? Here's a **demonstration**:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Hari"}
print(hash(my_dict))  # ❌ ERROR
```

Output:

```
TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
```

Because dictionaries **can change after creation**:

```python
my_dict["age"] = 25
```

→ Now the content has changed → so its hash value (if it had one) would become invalid!

---

## 🔐 But a key in a dictionary must stay stable

Imagine a key like this:

```python
locker_key = {"name": "Hari"}  # ❌ dict used as key
```

Now what if we changed it?

```python
locker_key["name"] = "Ramesh"
```

→ The locker system would get confused! You just changed the key it was using!

That’s why **mutable types like `dict`, `list`, and `set` are not hashable** — because they’re **not safe** as identifiers in a dictionary.

---

## ✅ What is safe (hashable)?

Immutable types — those that **can't be changed**.

| Type    | Can Change? | Hashable? |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `int`   | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes     |
| `str`   | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes     |
| `tuple` | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes\*   |
| `list`  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No      |
| `dict`  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No      |

\* only if tuple contains hashable values

---

## 👀 Visual Analogy

| Object Type           | Real World Example | Can be a Key?              |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `dict`                | Whiteboard         | ❌ You can erase/change it  |
| `list`                | Sticky Note        | ❌ You can peel and rewrite |
| `str`, `int`, `tuple` | Engraved ID card   | ✅ Fixed and unchangeable   |

---

## 🔧 Solution: Use `frozenset` to "freeze" a dict

```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
frozen = frozenset(d.items())  # ✅ This is hashable!
print(hash(frozen))            # ✅ This works
```

Now you can use it safely:

```python
cache = {}
cache[frozenset({'a': 1, 'b': 2}.items())] = "Cached Result"
```

---

## ✅ Final Code Example

```python
normal_dict = {'x': 10, 'y': 20}
try:
    hash(normal_dict)  # ❌
except TypeError as e:
    print("❌ Error:", e)

frozen_key = frozenset(normal_dict.items())  # ✅
print("✅ Hash:", hash(frozen_key))  # ✅ Works!
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

| Concept             | Explanation                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hashable**        | Can be used as dictionary key or set element                        |
| **Mutable**         | Can change (like dict, list) — not safe for hashing                 |
| **Dict Unhashable** | Because its content can change — not safe to be a key               |
| **Fix**             | Use `frozenset(dict.items())` to create a frozen, immutable version |

---

Want me to create a short diagram or animation that visually shows how a dict becomes unsafe vs how a frozen set becomes stable?
Great question, Hari! Let's explain **`hash`** and **`hashable`** in the simplest possible way — with real-life examples and Python code.

---

## 🔐 What is a **hash**?

A **hash** is a fixed-size number that uniquely represents an object’s content.

In Python, it's generated by the built-in function:

```python
hash(object)
```

---

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're locking your file in a **digital locker**.
To open it later, you need a **unique key** for that file.

That **key = hash value**

Example:

```python
print(hash("hari"))  # 3276048218444157600  (example)
```

Same input → same hash value
Different input → different hash value

---

## ✅ What is **hashable**?

An object is **hashable** if:

1. It has a `hash()` value.
2. Its content does not change (i.e. it’s **immutable**).

If both are true, then:
✅ It can be used as a **dictionary key** or put into a **set**.

---

## 🚫 What is **not hashable**?

Any object that is **mutable** (can change), like:

* `list`
* `dict`
* `set`

Why? Because if the content changes, its hash would change too — and that **breaks the dictionary**.

---

## 🧪 Python Example

```python
# Hashable
print(hash("hello"))     # ✅
print(hash(123))         # ✅
print(hash((1, 2, 3)))    # ✅ tuple with hashable items

# Not Hashable
print(hash([1, 2, 3]))    # ❌ list → TypeError
```

### ❗ Error:

```
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Type        | Mutable? | Hashable? | Can be dict key? |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| `int`       | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes            |
| `str`       | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes            |
| `tuple`     | ❌ No\*   | ✅ Yes\*   | ✅ Yes            |
| `list`      | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No      | ❌ No             |
| `dict`      | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No      | ❌ No             |
| `frozenset` | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes            |

> \* tuple is hashable **only if** all inside elements are also hashable

## 🎯 TL;DR

| Term         | Meaning                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hash()`     | Returns a number (unique identity) for an object          |
| **Hashable** | Can be used as dict key / set element — must be immutable |
| Not Hashable | List, Dict, Set (because they can change!)                |

---

Would you like a visual or animation that shows how hash maps work internally using keys and hash values?


Great Hari! Let's explore the **structure of `frozenset(d.items())`** step by step so it's crystal clear. 🧠✨

---

## Step-by-step Breakdown:

### Step 1: The Dictionary

```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

This is a **normal Python dictionary**:
It contains two key-value pairs:

```
'a' → 1  
'b' → 2
```

---

### Step 2: `d.items()`

```python
print(d.items())
```

This gives you a **`dict_items` object**, which looks like:

```
dict_items([('a', 1), ('b', 2)])
```

It’s basically a list of tuples — each tuple is a key-value pair.

---

### Step 3: `frozenset(d.items())`

```python
frozen = frozenset(d.items())
```

Now you're creating a **frozenset** — which is:

* Like a `set`, but **immutable**
* So you can't add/remove/update items

### ✅ Final Structure:

```
frozenset({('a', 1), ('b', 2)})
```

* It’s a set of **tuples**.
* Each tuple = one key-value pair from the dictionary.
* Order may vary, because sets are unordered.

---

### 🔍 Output of your code:

```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
frozen = frozenset(d.items())
print(frozen)
```

👀 You will see output like:

```
frozenset({('a', 1), ('b', 2)})
```

(Note: Order might be `('b', 2), ('a', 1)` depending on internal hashing.)

---

## 📦 Structure Visually:

```
frozenset
   └── set
        ├── ('a', 1)
        └── ('b', 2)
```

Each `('key', value)` tuple is inside the frozen set.

---

## ✅ Why is this useful?

Because:

* `dict` is unhashable ❌
* `frozenset(dict.items())` is hashable ✅

So now, you can use it like:

```python
cache = {}
cache[frozenset(d.items())] = "Cached result"
```

---

## TL;DR

| Expression             | Type                  | Example Output                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `d`                    | `dict`                | `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`                 |
| `d.items()`            | `dict_items`          | `dict_items([('a', 1), ('b', 2)])` |
| `frozenset(d.items())` | `frozenset` of tuples | `frozenset({('a', 1), ('b', 2)})`  |

---

Let me know if you want a diagram or how `frozenset` compares to `tuple`, `list`, or `set`!
