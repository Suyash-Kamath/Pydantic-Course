Great question! Let's break this down **step by step** so it’s **easy to understand**.

## 💡 What is a Decorator?

A **decorator** is a special kind of function in Python that:

> **Takes another function as input, adds extra functionality to it, and returns a new function.**

It’s like a **wrapper** that enhances a function **without modifying its code directly**.

---

## 🔍 Let's Understand Your Code

```python
import time

def timer(func):  # <-- This is the decorator function
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  # <-- This inner function wraps the original
        start = time.time()         # Start time
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
        end = time.time()           # End time
        print(f"{func.__name__} ran in {end - start} time")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### 🔄 Now look at this:

```python
@timer
def example_function(n):
    time.sleep(n)
```

This is **exactly same as**:

```python
def example_function(n):
    time.sleep(n)

example_function = timer(example_function)  # 👈 this is what @timer means internally
```

> So, the function `example_function` is passed into the `timer()` decorator, and it returns the `wrapper` function — which now replaces `example_function`.

---

## 🧠 Why does `timer(func)` accept `func` as a parameter?

Because the **decorator’s job is to enhance** another function.

So, `func` is the **original function** you want to decorate — in this case, `example_function`.

```python
@timer  ➜  example_function = timer(example_function)
```

That’s why the decorator needs to **accept that function as input**.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Execution

Here’s what happens when you call:

```python
example_function(2)
```

1. `example_function` is now the **wrapper** function returned by `timer`.

2. So you’re actually calling `wrapper(2)`.

3. Inside `wrapper`, it:

   * Starts the timer
   * Calls the **original** `example_function(2)` (which sleeps for 2 seconds)
   * Ends the timer
   * Prints how long it took
   * Returns the result (None here)

---

## 🧪 Output:

```bash
example_function ran in 2.0021 time
```

---

## 🔁 Why Use Decorators?

* For **logging**
* For **timing** functions
* For **authorization checks**
* For **caching results**
* To make code **clean, reusable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

Great! Let’s go **deeper** now and understand **how decorators work internally** — step by step — especially how **parameters flow** through `timer(func)` and `wrapper(*args, **kwargs)`.

---

## 🔁 Overview

When you do:

```python
@timer
def example_function(n):
    time.sleep(n)
```

This is exactly the same as:

```python
def example_function(n):
    time.sleep(n)

example_function = timer(example_function)  # 🧠 This is where magic happens
```

So what happens?

---

### 🧩 1. `timer(func)` is called

* Here, `func` refers to `example_function` — the actual function object.
* `timer()` takes this function and returns another function called `wrapper`.

So now, **`example_function` is replaced by `wrapper`**.

---

### 🧩 2. `wrapper(*args, **kwargs)` is stored

When you write:

```python
return wrapper
```

Python does not call `wrapper()` immediately — it just **returns the reference** to it. So now:

```python
example_function → wrapper
```

---

### 🧩 3. Now you call `example_function(2)`

But remember: `example_function` is actually `wrapper`, so this calls:

```python
wrapper(2)
```

Internally:

```python
def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
```

* `args = (2,)`
* `kwargs = {}`

So `wrapper` calls the original function like this:

```python
result = func(*args, **kwargs)
```

Which becomes:

```python
result = example_function(2)
```

So:

* You call `wrapper(2)`
* Which calls `example_function(2)` internally
* While also measuring time before/after

---

## 🔗 Internal Call Stack Summary

### Let's map the flow:

```python
@timer
def example_function(n):
    time.sleep(n)

example_function(2)
```

### Behind the scenes:

```python
# Step 1: @timer means this happens:
example_function = timer(example_function)

# Step 2: timer() is called:
def timer(func):  # func = example_function
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  # wrapper can take any inputs
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # calls the original example_function(n)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} ran in {end - start} time")
        return result
    return wrapper  # now example_function = wrapper

# Step 3: Now you call example_function(2)
# But that means: wrapper(2)
# And wrapper internally calls: func(2) -> the original example_function
```

---

## 💬 What are `*args` and `**kwargs` doing here?

They are **placeholders** that allow `wrapper()` to accept **any number of positional or keyword arguments**.

So the decorator works with **any function**, regardless of how many parameters it has.

For example:

```python
@timer
def add(a, b): return a + b

add(1, 2)  # works!

# args = (1, 2)
# kwargs = {}
```

Or:

```python
@timer
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet("Hari", greeting="Hi")  # args = ('Hari',), kwargs = {'greeting': 'Hi'}
```

---

## 🔄 In Simple Words:

* `timer(func)` → takes your function and returns a new one (`wrapper`)
* `wrapper(*args, **kwargs)` → allows you to pass anything to the original function
* Inside `wrapper`, you can add extra behavior like timing, logging, etc.
* The original function still runs with its parameters passed through

---

Let me know if you'd like to see:

* How to return modified results from the wrapper
* Decorators with parameters (like `@timer(log_to_file=True)`)
* Or chain multiple decorators together!


Awesome question — this shows you're **thinking deeply**. Let's unpack this.

---

## 🎯 Why `return result` inside the decorator?

```python
def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    start = time.time()
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    end = time.time()
    print(f"{func.__name__} ran in {end - start} time")
    return result  # 👈 WHY?
```

---

## ✅ Short Answer:

> You **return `result`** so that the **decorated function still behaves the same** as the original one — meaning, it **returns the same value**.

If you don’t return it, any code that depends on the **return value** of the function will break.

---

## 🔍 Example Without `return result`

```python
@timer
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

x = add(2, 3)
print("Result is:", x)
```

### If you forget `return result`, then:

* `x` becomes `None`
* Even though `add(2, 3)` is `5`, it doesn't return it back!
* So you'd get:

```
add ran in 0.000001 time
Result is: None  ❌
```

---

## 🔁 What `return result` does:

* Executes the original function
* Captures the returned value (`result = func(...)`)
* Returns it back to the caller
* So the decorator doesn't change how the function works externally

---

## 💡 Think of it like this:

You're wrapping a gift (function) with fancy wrapping paper (decorator), but you still want to **give the gift inside (original return value)** to the receiver.

---

## 🔧 You may skip `return` **only if:**

* Your function doesn’t return anything
* And you don’t care about the output

But as good practice: **always return the result**, unless you're sure it's not needed.

Would you like me to show you an example with a return AND one without it to show the difference clearly?
